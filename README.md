/***************************************************************************************/

PetStore
Your assignment is to create a very simple Petstore application. The PetStore should use 
MVC.NET and Entity Framework. Refer back to the video course for assistance. This home-
work should be checked into github and deployed to your website for a grade.

NOTE: the material in the video AND the assignment are required for this homework. Itâ€™s 
entirely possible that there will be a pop quick the week I get back.

The Site will have three areas: 
Home
Inventory
Manage

The idea is manage will only be seen by administrators who have logged into the site 
(do not worry about protecting this at this point). Home and Inventory are available 
to anyone. 

You have free reign to design your homepage; however, I would very much like to see you 
use the client side technologies we discussed in the first portion of the class.

/***************************************************************************************/

The following wireframes are a loose explanation of what each section should contain:

Home: Can be designed anyway you like. Here is an example of what you might pick.
Data: Static text

Inventory: Should allow a customer to browse the animals available in your inventory. 
There should be a View or more option for the customer to view a detailed record of the
animal.
Data: Picture, name, description (partial)

Detail: Provides additional information about the animal. 
Data: name, description (full), date received, quantity, and price.

Manage: Follows the same pattern as the movie tutorial. You should be able to do all 
CRUD operations with the Pets.
Data: name, description (full), date received, quantity, and price.
